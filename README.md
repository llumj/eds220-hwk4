Title
Thomas Fire False Color Analysis Project

About:
This repository contains analysis and visualization of the Thomas Fire using satellite imagery and geospatial data. The project utilizes false color imagery to highlight various features of the landscape affected by the fire. By overlaying the fire perimeter with remote sensing data, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fire's impact.

Repository Structure
data: Contains the raw and processed data files used for analysis. One is a shapefile of the Thomas Fire boundary and the other is a geodatabase containing all California fires.

notebooks: Jupyter notebooks that document the analysis and visualization steps.

README.md: Overview of the repository and instructions for use.

Data:
The data used in this project includes satellite imagery from the Landsat program and the fire perimeter shapefile for the Thomas Fire.

Satellite Imagery: Landsat imagery accessed via the server at UCSB

Fire Perimeter: Shapefile of the Thomas Fire perimeter, obtained from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). https://www.fire.ca.gov/

To access and run the code, ensure that the data is placed in the appropriate directories as described in the repository structure.
